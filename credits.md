# Credits
---

This site ist hosted hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is written and updated by me. 

I used `HTML`, `SASS` and `CSS` and build the website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

For people who just start mit `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` I can recommend [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com).

I used [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to generate the favicon. 

Also thanks to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) which is always a help if you struggle with something.
