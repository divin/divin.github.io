This project is still in early development and I can&#8217;t say much about it yet, but it&#8217;s a small 2D game. I&#8217;m developing it in Godot, an open source game engine. I&#8217;m a bit busy with university at the moment, but as soon as I have something presentable I&#8217;ll update this post! (No link yet 🙃)</p>

                            <p>This website was a side project that I started in February 2021. The main goal was to learn web development and create my first personal website. My very first website was just a <code>Jekyll</code> theme, not very personal. I started writing this site in <code>React</code>, but I realized that I should start with simple <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code> first. On my way to create this page, I stumbled across <code>SASS</code>, which makes the process a lot easier. For compiling I used CodeKit. The source code is on GitHub and the page is hosted through GitHub Pages. I implemented a dark and light mode, depending on the user&#8217;s system settings. The site was built using the mobile-first design approach. If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me 😌.</p>
                            
                            <p>This project is still in progress and I will update this page with content but also with functionality in the future.</p>
