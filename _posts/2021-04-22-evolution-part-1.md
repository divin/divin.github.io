Recently, I've been looking into how to create random maps in Godot. The topic of creating something, like a map, with just a few lines of code has always interested me. I haven't done anything like this yet, but I'm working on a small project where I can easily implement this.

The basic idea is simple, you create a noise map by a random noise algorithm (like the "classic" Perlin noise or the improved and open source version, the [OpenSimplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimplex_noise)) and based on this noise the map is created. Noise algorithms are a very interesting topic in their own right, which I may go into in more detail in the future, but for now let's move on. In Godot, you can easily create noise using the [`OpenSimplexNoise`](https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/classes/class_opensimplexnoise.html) class. You can use the `get_image()` method to create a noise image that looks like this, for example:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![](/assets/images/blog/2021-04-22/noisemap.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}](/assets/images/blog/2021-04-18/noisemap.png)
{: refdef}

You are probably asking yourself, how do we get from this to a map? Well, as mentioned the basic idea is simple, for each pixel we now have a `float` value between 0 and 1. You can now assign a specific tile (e.g. grass) for each subrange from 0 to 1 (e.g. 0.25 to 0.50).

_Sidenote:_ For my project I used a tileset from [kenney.nl] (https://www.kenney.nl), which I recommend for prototyping. 

That is, you take the noise image, loop through each pixel, and assign a specific tile based on the value of that pixel. That's the basic idea, you can see a playable example (works best on the desktop) on my [itch.io page](https://divinism.itch.io), or click the link below. I also have the source code on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/divin), see [Evolution](https://github.com/divin/Evolution), as this example is part of a small project I'm working on.
