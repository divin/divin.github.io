# Hello! 

I just finished creating this website, it took me almost a month and three iterations, but now I am more or less done. This is my first self-written website in `HTML` and `CSS`. It was a nice experience and I learned a lot! I will now try to fill this site with _more_ content, maybe do some optimizations and improvements. If you are an experienced web developer and just stumbled across this site, feel free to [contact](/contact) me with any feedback or criticism ðŸ˜Œ.
