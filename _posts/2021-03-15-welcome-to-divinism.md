**Hello** <span class = "waving-hand">ðŸ‘‹</span>
I just finished creating this website, it took me almost a month and three iterations, but now I am more or less done. This is my first self-written website. I used mainly `HTML`, `SASS/CSS` and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Head over to [Projects](/projects) if you want to learn more about this project. It was a nice experience and I learned a lot! In the next days and weeks I'll fill this site with _more_ content, maybe do some optimizations and improvements.  The next step is to implement comments on these blog posts. If you are an experienced web developer and just stumbled across this site, feel free to [contact](/contact) me with any feedback or criticism ðŸ˜Œ.
