Is Japanese and originally means _"Great Lord"_, it is the origin of the English word _"Tycoon"_. This project is still in early development and I can't say much about it yet, but it's a small 2D game. I'm developing it in Godot, an open source game engine. I'm a bit busy with university at the moment, but as soon as I have something presentable I'll update this post! (No link yet 🙃)
