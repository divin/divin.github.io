This website was a side project that I started in February 2021. The main goal was to learn web development and create my first personal website. My very first website was just a `Jekyll` theme, not very personal. I started writing this site in `React`, but I realized that I should start with simple `HTML` and `CSS` first. On my way to create this page, I stumbled across `SASS`, which makes the process a lot easier. For compiling I used Prepros. Currently I'm switching back to `Jekyll`, it's a bit simpler to handle blog posts. The source code is on GitHub and the page is hosted through GitHub Pages. I implemented a dark and light mode, depending on the user's system settings. The site was built using the mobile-first design approach. If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me ðŸ˜Œ.

This project is still in progress and I will update this page with content but also with functionality in the future.
