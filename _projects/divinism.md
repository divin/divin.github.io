excerpt: My personal website, which I have been working on since mid February 2021.

This website was a side project I started in mid February 2021. The main goal was to learn web development and create my first personal website. My very first website was just a `Jekyll` theme, not very personal. I started writing this site in `React`, but I realized that I should start with simple `HTML` and `CSS` first. On the way to create this page, I stumbled across `SASS`, which makes the process a lot easier. To create the page, I switched back to `Jekyll`. Markdown and Liquid make the whole process a lot easier. The source code is on GitHub and the page is hosted through GitHub Pages. I implemented a dark and light mode, depending on the user`s system settings. The page was built using the mobile-first design approach. It is also built in a modular fashion to load only the necessary styles and components. On Lighthouse, the site scores 97 (even 100 on good days).

If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me ðŸ˜Œ.

This will be a work in progress project as I will update this page with content and maybe functionality in the future.
