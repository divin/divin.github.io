<p>Today we are improving our mechanic from <a href="https://divin.github.io/tutorials/godot-tutorial-1/">Tutorial 1</a>. The result will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tutorial_2/result.gif" alt="Result" title="Result" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Looks like similar as before, right? Indeed but we got rid of the “A” button to switch between draw and drag mode. Thanks to the guys on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/">Godot subreddit</a>, who gave me feedback on my previous tutorial.</p>

<p>Again a little disclaimer:</p>

<p><em>This tutorial is more aimed for people with a bit of knowledge in Godot and GDScript.
I like to use a bit more Object Oriented Programming (OOP) style and usually try to define the variables and methods correctly by limiting
the data type (for example</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var foo : String = "bar"</code> <em>). This is helpful to prevent misuse of variables/methods and make bug fixing a bit easier in my opinion.</em></p>

<p>Download links for the source code are on my GitHub (or visit the <a href="#download">Download section</a>) :)</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-main-scene">Creating the main scene</h1>

<p>We start with something simple this time, the main scene. Just create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node2D</code>, name it “Main” and we are done. 
This time we don’t need a script as everything will be handled by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Paper</code> scene itself. Fancy, right? :)</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-paper-scene">Creating the paper scene</h1>

<p>Now to the hard part, we create a new scene, select as our root node a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TextureRect</code> and name it “Paper”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tutorial_2/texture_rect.gif" alt="TextureRect" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>After that we set the texture for our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TextureRect</code>. Next we want to create two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area2D</code> objects.</p>

<h2 id="adding-area2d-objects">Adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area2D</code> objects</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area2D</code> objects are great to detect collision, we use it to have two different areas on our paper we can distinguish. So, let’s start.</p>

<p>We add the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area2D</code> and name it “DragArea”. To this area we add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CollisionShape2D</code> as child this is our collision area. As shape we choose a Rectangle.
You should align the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CollisionShape2D</code> to fit the top part of the paper. It should look like this if you’re done:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tutorial_2/first_area.png" alt="area_1" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>For the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area2D</code> we do basically the same thing except we name it “DrawArea” and align the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CollisionShape2D</code> to fit the lower part of the paper. 
When done our paper should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tutorial_2/second_area.png" alt="area_2" class="align-center" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tutorial_2/paper_scene.png" alt="paper" class="align-left" />
For convenience I left a gap between the two areas. You should avoid overlapping areas.
Our scene should look like this the picture on the left.</p>
