I"u<p>This site was created with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.
The theme is called <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> and minor changes to this theme were done by me. I used <a href="https://favicon.io">Favicon.io</a> to generate the favicon. The Back To Top button was made via <a href="https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top">Vanialla Back To Top</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to these great developers! Feel free to check them out :)</p>
