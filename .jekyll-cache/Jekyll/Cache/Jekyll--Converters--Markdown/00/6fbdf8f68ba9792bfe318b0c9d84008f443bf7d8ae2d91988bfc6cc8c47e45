I"<p>This site was created with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. The theme is called <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> and minor changes to this theme were done by me. I used <a href="https://favicon.io">Favicon.io</a> to generate the favicon.</p>

<p>Thanks to all these great developers! Feel free to check them out :)</p>
