<div class="notice"> 
<h1 id="notion-to-github">Notion-To-Github</h1>

<p>I’ve created a script with the inoffical <a href="https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py/">Notion Python API</a> which access a table at a public Notion page and create with the content of this table, my website. I can now use Notion as my Content Management System (CMS). It does not support all Notions blocks but for the most part it works. Notion will release an offical API in Spring 2021, hopefully I can improve this script as soon as I’ve access to this.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developed in Python</li>
  <li>Supports most Notion blocks</li>
  <li>Custom build but should suit all <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes theme</a> builds with some minor changes</li>
</ul>
