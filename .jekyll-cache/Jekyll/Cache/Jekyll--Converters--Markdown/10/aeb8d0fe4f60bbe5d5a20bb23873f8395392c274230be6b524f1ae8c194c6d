<p>Today we are improving our mechanic from <a href="https://divin.github.io/tutorials/godot-tutorial-1/">Tutorial 1</a>. The result will look like this:</p>

<p>I got some good feedback on Reddit how we could improve this mechanic.
In the previouse tutorial we switched between the “dragging” and “drawing” by a key press. This is fine of course but needs an user input which could make the controls not so smooth as some wish. Therefore we do implent today an option where we switch between drag and draw mode by simply being on he correct area.</p>

<p>We create a main scene, do nothing
We create a paper scene, import texture for the setup,</p>
