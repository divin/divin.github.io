<p>Today we are improving our mechanic from <a href="https://divin.github.io/tutorials/godot-tutorial-1/">Tutorial 1</a>. The result will look like this:</p>

<p>Looks like similiar as before, right? Indeed but we got rid of the ‚ÄúA‚Äù button to switch between draw and drag mode. Thanks to the Reddit guys on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/">Godot subreddit</a>, who gave me feedback on my previouse tutorial.</p>

<p>Again a little disclaimer:</p>

<p><em>This tutorial is more aimed for people with a bit of knowledge in Godot and GDScript.
I like to use a bit more Object Oriented Programming (OOP) style and usually try to define the variables and methods correctly by limiting
the data type (for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var foo : String = "bar"</code>). This is helpful to prevent misuse of variables/methods and make bug fixing a bit easier in my opinion.</em></p>

<p>Download links for the source code are on my GitHub (or visit the <a href="#download">Download section</a>) :)</p>

<p>We create a main scene, do nothing
We create a paper scene, import texture for the setup,</p>
