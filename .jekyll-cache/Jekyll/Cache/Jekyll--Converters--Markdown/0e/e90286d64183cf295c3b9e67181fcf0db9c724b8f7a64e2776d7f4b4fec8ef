<p>In this tutorial I’ll show you how to make a drawable and draggable paper in Godot. The result will look like this:</p>

<p>This tutorial is more aimed for people with a bit of knowledge in Godot.</p>

<p>The only changes I did to the project settings were made under <em>Display/Window</em></p>

<p>We will start with the interesting part, the paper itself.</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-main-scene">Creating the main scene</h1>

<p>First we create the main scene. We choose as our root node a 2D scene and call it “Main”. After that we attach a script to it and call it also “Main”.</p>

<p>Here is the complete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Main.gd</code>:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Click me to collapse/fold.</summary>
  <code> 
    class_name Main
    extends Node2D

    # Grab the Paper when ready
    onready var paper : Paper = $Paper

    # Bool to store if pen is selected
    var pen_selected : bool = false

    func _input(event) -&gt; void:

      # Bool to check if the button is just pressed (not needed if you assigned an action key)
      var just_pressed : bool = event.is_pressed() and not event.is_echo()

      # Check if the "A" button was just pressed
      if Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_A) and just_pressed:
        self.select_pen()

    func select_pen() -&gt; void:
      # Function which selectes the pen

      # Negate pen_selected
      self.pen_selected = not self.pen_selected

      # Set pen_selected from the paper
      paper.set_pen_selected(self.pen_selected)
  </code>
</details>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class_name Main
extends Node2D

# Grab the Paper when ready
onready var paper : Paper = $Paper

# Bool to store if pen is selected

  # Bool to check if the button is just pressed (not needed if you assigned an action key)
  var just_pressed : bool = event.is_pressed() and not event.is_echo()

  # Set pen_selected from the paper
  paper.set_pen_selected(self.pen_selected)

<p>Next we want to create the paper.</p>
