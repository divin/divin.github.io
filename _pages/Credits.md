This site was created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  
The theme is called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and minor changes to this theme were done by me.  
I used [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io) to generate the favicon.  
The Back To Top button was made via [Vanialla Back To Top](https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top).  

Thanks to these great developers! Feel free to check them out :)
