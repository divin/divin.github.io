## Currently
---

I'm doing my Bachelor thesis in computational physics, due to finish around July. In my bachelor thesis I do numerical hydrodynamic simulations of migrating planets in a solar system. After I graduated I'll do my master degree in pyhsics, this will take another year. By the end of July 2022, I'll be finished and hopefully start working.
