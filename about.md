Hello and welcome to my space 👨‍🚀

I am Divin, a physics (B. Sc.) student from southern Germany. I speak `code` and I'm very interested in game development, machine learning, physics simulations and many other things related to programming. I also like to draw and make music. Basically any kind of craft where you create something from scratch. If you want to learn more about me check out my [Curriculum Vitae](vita.html).

This website is just a portfolio at the moment, but hopefully it will grow into something bigger in the future 😎
