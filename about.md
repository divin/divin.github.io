# About Me
---

Hello and welcome to my space üë®‚ÄçüöÄ

I am Divin, a physics (B. Sc.) student from southern Germany. I speak `code` and I'm very interested in game development, machine learning, physics simulations and many other things related to programming. I also like to draw and make music. Basically any kind of craft where you create something from scratch.

On this page I will post some of my [projects](projects.html), but I will also post something on my [blog](blog.html) from time to time. If you want to chat or have a question, feel free to [contact](contact.html) me üòå

This website is just a portfolio at the moment, but hopefully it will grow into something bigger in the future üòé.
