      <p><p>My personal website, which I have been working on since mid February 2021.</p>
</p>
      <details>
        <summary>More Info</summary>
        <p>This website was a side project I started in mid February 2021. The main goal was to learn web development and create my first personal website. My very first website was just a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code> theme, not very personal. I started writing this site in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">React</code>, but I realized that I should start with simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTML</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSS</code> first. On the way to create this page, I stumbled across <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SASS</code>, which makes the process a lot easier. To create the page, I switched back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code>. Markdown and Liquid make the whole process a lot easier. The source code is on GitHub and the page is hosted through GitHub Pages. I implemented a dark and light mode, depending on the user`s system settings. The page was built using the mobile-first design approach. It is also built in a modular fashion to load only the necessary styles and components. On Lighthouse, the site scores 97 (even 100 on good days).</p>

<p>If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me 😌.</p>

<p>This will be a work in progress project as I will update this page with content and maybe functionality in the future.</p>

        <p>Is Japanese and originally means <em>“Great Lord”</em>, it is the origin of the English word <em>“Tycoon”</em>. This project is still in early development and I can’t say much about it yet, but it’s a small 2D game. I’m developing it in Godot, an open source game engine. I’m a bit busy with university at the moment, but as soon as I have something presentable I’ll update this post! (No link yet 🙃)</p>
