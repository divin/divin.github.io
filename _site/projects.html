      <h2>Divinism 🛠</h2>
      <p><p>This website was a side project that I started in February 2021. The main goal was to learn web development and create my first personal website. My very first website was just a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code> theme, not very personal. I started writing this site in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">React</code>, but I realized that I should start with simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTML</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSS</code> first. On my way to create this page, I stumbled across <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SASS</code>, which makes the process a lot easier. For compiling I used Prepros. Currently I’m switching back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code>, it’s a bit simpler to handle blog posts. The source code is on GitHub and the page is hosted through GitHub Pages. I implemented a dark and light mode, depending on the user’s system settings. The site was built using the mobile-first design approach. If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me 😌.</p>

<p>This project is still in progress and I will update this page with content but also with functionality in the future.</p>

      <h2>Taikun (jap. たいくん / 大君) 🛠</h2>
      <p><p>Is Japanese and originally means <em>“Great Lord”</em>, it is the origin of the English word <em>“Tycoon”</em>. This project is still in early development and I can’t say much about it yet, but it’s a small 2D game. I’m developing it in Godot, an open source game engine. I’m a bit busy with university at the moment, but as soon as I have something presentable I’ll update this post! (No link yet 🙃)</p>
